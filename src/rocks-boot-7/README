Rocks-boot-7 uses lorax to do most of the work of creating product.img initrd
and the live file system used by anaconda for installation. 

rocks-boot-7 is built LAST when building the kernel roll. All other kernel roll
rpms must already be compiled. 

Lorax has an extensive templating system to add packages to bootable media. Typically, close to 700 packages are installed then unneeded items are removed to build a smaller LiveOS image.   Our goal is to use as much of the stock Lorax-based install as possible, while adding Rocks-required packages.

Where This build finds packages.
- Rolls installed in the build system. Required rolls are core and OS. 
  -- Typically an updates roll is also added to get an updated kernel RPM
- The RPMS directory of the kernel roll itself.
  -- This enables various Rocks-created packages to be installed 

Where are anaconda changes?
 -- the anaconda-rocks rpm defined in this roll should handle the overlay
    of anaconda files (using product.img).
