These are hooks into anaconda to manage some rocks-added capabilities.
#1 - lighttpd service (used for avalanche/scalable installation) must be started in
the context of the initial ram disk AND restarted when the installer 
transitions from its initrd state to the running state.  It's a more
complicated setup because of this.

#2 - rockspart service. This enables stateful partitions on compute nodes. This needs to be called when in the running state, but before anaconda the kickstart
file is read by anaconda. It is setup as systemd service. It is turned on 
in the postinstall configuration of the rocks-boot-7 package.
